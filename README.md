# HTML5 Live Code Presentation

## Overview
This is the source code from a AngularJS meetup I presented at in May of 2014.

The concept was to give a intermediate overview of AngularJS and demonstrate some of it's key qualities. The sample application constructs dynamic HTML forms via JSON.

 * two way data binding
 * directives, services and controllers
 * dependency injection
 * expressive HTML templates

## Notable directories & files
***app/js/directives/stevedore***
***app/js/services***
***app/js/controllers.js***

### Note
The application architecture used here is not an ideal architecture for a production scale application. I have used some shortcuts and choose not to abstract certain code into an overly modular setup for ease of presentation to first time Angular developers.
